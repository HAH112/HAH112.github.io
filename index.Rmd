<p align="left">I'm a fourth-year PhD student in biostatistics at the University of Pittsburgh. In 2018, I received a BS in applied mathematics from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). I then entered the master in biostatistics
program at [Columbia University Mailman school of public health](http://www.mailman.columbia.edu) and received the MS degree in 2020. My research interests include statistical modeling, statistical inference and machine learning on health science data. [Details about my academic journey.](about.html) 

I am currently seeking biostatistics internship opportunities for the summer of 2025.
