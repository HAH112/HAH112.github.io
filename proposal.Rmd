This is the course project for Introduction to RCT course(spring 2019). I prepared a proposal for a hypothetical NIH phase III two-parallel-group randomized clinical trial evaluating efficacy and safety of LY3298176, a promising novel intervention for type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the proposal, I addressed key issues related to randomized clinical trials: safety, outcome variables, hypothesis formulation, power, stopping rules, etc. The proposal is linked down below.
