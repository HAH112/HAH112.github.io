      <strong>Research Project:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Relationship of education level and Apoe4 gene status with the rate of decline <br>in cognitive level, Jun.2019-May.2020. &nbspMentored by <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/zjin">Dr. Zhezhen Jin.</a></em></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Processed data for modeling, along with exploratory analysis</li>
          <li>Investigated associations between risk factors (educational level and ApoE4 gene <br>status) and changes in a variety of cognitive outcomes, including short term <br>memory, recognition memory, etc., adjusting for age, gender, etc.</li>
          <li>Fitted GEE models and included risk factor-by-time interaction terms to evaluate <br>associations stated above</li>
          <li>Checked linearity assumption by plotting marginal residuals vs. explanatory variables</li>
          <li>Assessed the effects of missing data by multiple imputation and pooled analysis</li>
          <li>Wrote statistical reports, and presented results to professor and collaborators</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <strong>Course projects:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Introduction to RCT course project, Apr.2019</em></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Prepared proposal for hypothetical NIH phase III two-parallel-group randomized <br>clinical trial evaluating efficacy and safety of LY3298176, a promising novel intervention<br> for type 2 diabetes mellitus</li>
          <li>Addressed key issues related to randomized clinical trials: safety, outcome variables, <br>hypothesis formulation, power, stopping rules, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Data Science II course project, May.2019</em></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Performed descriptive analysis to explore the associations between cardiovascular<br> disease status and predictors</li>
          <li>Built and compared several classifiers, including regularized logistic regression, <br>linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, tree-based models and support vector machine to<br> classify the subjects based on their cardiovascular disease status</li>
